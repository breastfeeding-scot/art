# Join us to celebrate the publication of the 9th edition of the Art of Breastfeeding!

La Leche League in Scotland have planned three **free** events to celebrate the newest release of La Leche League International’s bestseller, The Art of Breastfeeding.

The book has been updated by a team of four writers, including Jayne Joyce from LLLGB. Jayne will be at each of our events to discuss the book and its content with a local panellist.
